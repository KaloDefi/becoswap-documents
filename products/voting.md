# Voting

Check out BecoSwap native voting portal here: [https://snapshot.org/\#/becoswap.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/becoswap.eth)

**Core** - proposals posted by the BecoSwap team. The results will be actioned.

**Community** - proposals posted by the BecoSwap community. These are used to propose ideas and show the communities point of view. The BecoSwap team reviews every community vote and will often move any with strong community support up to the CORE proposal level.
