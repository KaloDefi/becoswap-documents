# Liquidity Pools

\*\*\*\*[**Becoswap pools** ](https://exchange.becoswap.com/#/pool)allow you to provide liquidity by adding your tokens to liquidity pools.

When you add your token to a liquidity pool you will receive Liquidity Pool \(LP\) tokens.

  
As an example, if you deposited **BECO** and **BNB** into a liquidity pool, you would receive **BECO-BNB LP** tokens. 

The number of LP tokens you receive represents your portion of the BECO-BNB liquidity pool. 

You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing your liquidity.

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss.  
[“Simply put, impermanent loss is the difference between holding tokens in an AMM and holding them in your wallet.” - Nate Hindman](https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22)

It’s not all bad for liquidity providers as you will also be given a reward in the form of trading fees. Whenever someone trades Becoswap, the trader pays a 0.2% fee, of which 0.2% is added to the liquidity pool of the swap pair they traded on. 

For example:

* There are 10 LP tokens representing 10 BECO and 10 BNB tokens.
* 1 LP token = 1 BECO + 1 BNB
* Someone trades 10 BECO for 10 BNB.
* Someone else trades 10 BNB for 10 BECO.
* The BECO/BNB liquidity pool now has 10.017 BECO and 10.017 BNB.
* Each LP token is now worth 1.00017 BECO + 1.00017 BNB.

To make being a liquidity provider even more worth your while, you can also put your LP tokens to work whipping up some fresh yield on the [BECO farms \(here\)](https://becoswap.com), while still earning your 0.2% trading fee reward.
