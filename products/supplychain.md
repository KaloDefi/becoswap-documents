# NFT Supply Chain

Blockchains are built as distributed systems that maintain a unique and transparent data repository. Each node of the network \(each party\) contributes to adding new data and verifying their integrity. This means that all information stored on a blockchain is accessible to all parties involved, so one company can easily verify what information is being broadcasted by the other.

Nft Supplychain is developed based on the [erc1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) standard that allows managing multiple items in the supply chain with significant cost reduction.
